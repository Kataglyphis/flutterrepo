# Privacy Policy

I, Jonas Heinle, take the protection of your personal data very seriously. In order for you to fully utilize my internet offering, it is necessary to collect certain information when visiting my website. In this privacy policy, I inform you about when I collect data about you, how I use this data, and what rights you have as users of the internet offering.

## I. Who is the responsible party according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)?

## III. What information do I collect and for what purpose is it used?
1. Visit to the website (server logs)  
   Every visit to our website is logged in a log file to ensure data security. The following data is stored for a maximum of 24 hours:

   - Name of the accessed file
   - Date and time of access
   - Transferred data volume
   - Message whether the access was successful
   - IP address of the user or provider
   - Internet address of the previous page (referrer)
   - Information about the program that retrieves the data (User-Agent)

   Direct identification of you based on the IP address is not possible and is excluded.

   The IP address is only evaluated in the event of attacks on my website, violations of good manners, or if the internet offering is used for other illegal activities. In this case, identification of you based on the IP address is only possible through your internet provider as part of a police or prosecutorial investigation.

   This data is not used for statistical purposes. It is not shared with third parties for commercial or non-commercial purposes.

   Further information about the use of cookies on this website can be found in our cookie policy.

2. Entry of personal data in forms  
   Within the website, there is the possibility to enter personal data for some (possibly upcoming) information offers. For example, if you subscribe to our newsletter or other mailing services, you must provide your email address. If you register for an event or order information material, we also need your name and address.

   It is your free decision whether you enter this data. Only data necessary for the desired information service is requested. We treat the data confidentially and only use it for the purposes for which it was collected.

   If storage of your personal data is necessary for the information service used, your data will only be stored for as long as necessary to fulfill the offer or the tasks of the ministry for which the data was collected.

   If such an information offer is completed, terminated by us, or canceled by you, the personal data will be irrevocably deleted after a maximum of six weeks.

3. Communication via contact form or email  
   If you send us a message by email, the data you provide will be used to correspond with you.

   Communication via email may have security vulnerabilities. Emails can be intercepted and viewed by skilled internet users on their way to me. If we receive an email from you, we assume that we are entitled to reply by email. Otherwise, another form of communication should be considered, for example, by post.

4. Links to websites of other providers and social media  
   My website contains links to websites of other providers and social media. I expressly point out that these process the data of their users in accordance with their own privacy policies. I have no influence on whether these providers comply with data protection regulations.

## V. How do I protect children and adolescents (minor protection)?
Persons under 18 years of age should not transmit personal data to us without the consent of their parents or legal guardians. I do not request personal data from children and adolescents without the consent of their parents or legal guardians. I do not knowingly collect such data and do not disclose it to third parties.

## VI. On what basis do I collect personal data?
The use of our internet offering is generally possible without providing personal information. If I collect personal data from you on this page, it is only done with your revocable consent (for example, when sending newsletters according to Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR) or to carry out an order process (for example, for publications according to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR).

Otherwise, I only process personal data if I am obligated to do so by law (according to Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR).

## VII. To which recipients do I pass on data?
To provide the internet offering, I work with external service providers. If personal data needs to be processed (for example, for sending newsletters or if you order publications), I have taken technical and organizational measures to ensure that the data protection regulations are also observed by external service providers.

## VIII. What rights do you have as the data subject?
As users of the internet offering provided by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety, and Consumer Protection, you have the rights listed in Articles 12 to 22 of the GDPR with regard to the processing of personal data:

Exercising these rights is free of charge for you and is granted upon request within the scope of your interest in information. Please contact the data protection officer of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety, and Consumer Protection for this purpose.
